# Emotion detection

## Introduction

This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of **seven categories**, using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the **FER-2013** dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with **seven emotions** - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

## Dataset:

## Algorithm

* First, we use **haar cascade** to detect faces in each frame of the webcam feed.

* The region of image containing the face is resized to **48x48** and is passed as input to the CNN.

* The network outputs a list of **softmax scores** for the seven classes.

* The emotion with maximum score is displayed on the screen.
